# Python Tasks (04,05,06)

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that includes random module,Threads and Inheritance (Overloading) Concepts.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Scripts

### 1. Employee Details Generator

#### Description

This script generates random employee details, including employee IDs, locations, and salaries.

#### Usage

####  Run the script

Enter the number of producers and consumers when prompted.

### 3. Shape Area Calculator

#### Description

  1. Base Class : The class from which the property is inherited is known as base class.
  2. Derived Class : The class that inherits property is known as derived class.

2. **Overloading** : Two or more methods with same name but different number of parameters is known as Method Overloading.

####  Run the script

Select an option from the menu to calculate the area of the chosen shape.

## Code Execution Instruction

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the following command:
   -  git clone  <repository_url>.

2. **Navigate to repository directory** :
   - cd  <repository_directory>.
   
3. **Run the script** using Python:
   -  python filename.py.

4. It results the output based on the python script you are running.
